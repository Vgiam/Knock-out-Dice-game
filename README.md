# Knock-out-Dice-game
A simple dice game!
Each player chooses a “knock out number” – either 6, 7, 8, or 9. More than one player can choose the same number. Players take turns throwing both dice, once each turn. Add the number of both dice for the score. If a player throws a 6, 7, 8 or 9 they are knocked out of the game until the next round
